# Heart Disease Analysis ðŸ’“

Data has the power to tell stories, uncover patterns, and drive decisions that can save lives. In this project, we embark on a structured journey to analyze a heart disease dataset using Python, combining technical skills with a mission to extract meaningful insights from raw numbers.

This journey is not just about charts and graphsâ€”it's about understanding the factors that impact one of the most critical health issues worldwide: heart disease.
